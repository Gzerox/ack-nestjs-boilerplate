# Overview

The Setting module in ACK NestJS Boilerplate centralizes application configuration management by providing:

- Access to application configuration values
- Type-safe response DTOs for various setting categories
- Centralized service for retrieving settings from different sources
- API endpoints to expose settings to front-end applications

Unlike traditional settings modules that might store settings in a database, this implementation primarily retrieves values from the application's configuration (via ConfigService) and formats them into structured response objects.
